# sort

**sort** is a school project. 

Get the entire project by `git clone` and then, create a **bin** directory in order to compile it. 

`mkdir bin`

Just do `make` to compile it, you don't need any non-standard library. 
Test the project and compare output with your system `sort` command with the **run.sh** bash script. 

`chmod u+x run.sh`
`./run.sh textfile` ( for example, `./run.sh sample/haxe` )
